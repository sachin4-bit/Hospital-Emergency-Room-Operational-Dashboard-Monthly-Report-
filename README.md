## 🏥 Key Operational Metrics

| KPI                            | Value         |
| ------------------------------ | ------------- |
| **Total Patients**             | 506           |
| **Avg Wait Time**              | 35.58 minutes |
| **Patient Satisfaction Score** | 5.18 / 10     |

➡ Indicates moderate patient satisfaction with noticeable room for improvement in ER operations.

---

## 👩‍⚕️ Patient Flow & Admission Status

| Status           | Count | %   |
| ---------------- | ----- | --- |
| **Not Admitted** | 548   | 54% |
| **Admitted**     | 476   | 46% |

➡ Nearly half of patients required admission, showing a high burden of serious medical cases.

---

## 🕒 ER Timeliness (Operational Efficiency)

| Category    | %   |
| ----------- | --- |
| **On-Time** | 61% |
| **Delayed** | 39% |

➡ Shows moderate efficiency but delays affect throughput & satisfaction.

---

## 👥 Gender Distribution

* **Female:** 54%
* **Male:** 46%

➡ Female patients slightly higher in ER visits for the selected month.

---

## 📅 Patient Count by Age Group

| Age Group | Count |
| --------- | ----- |
| 0–09      | 54    |
| 10–19     | 72    |
| 20–29     | 75    |
| 30–39     | 62    |
| 40–49     | 63    |
| 50–59     | 49    |
| 60–69     | 74    |
| 70–79     | 57    |

➡ Two key heavy-demand groups: **20–29** & **60–69**, indicating both young adults and older populations rely heavily on ER care.

---

## 🏥 Department Referral Breakdown

Most common referrals (descending order):

1. None (treated directly in ER)
2. General Practice
3. Orthopedics
4. Physiotherapy
5. Neurology
6. Cardiology
7. Gastroenterology
8. Renal

➡ Many cases managed directly in ER, while major referrals involve GP and orthopedic care.

---

## 🔁 Time Filter Dimensions

Dashboard allows analysis across:
✔ **Months (Jan–Dec)**
✔ **Years (2023 & 2024)**

➡ Enables seasonal & yearly trend monitoring.

---

## 💡 Key Insights

✔ ER deals with high-severity cases due to 46% admissions
✔ Wait time (~35 min) impacts overall satisfaction
✔ On-time patient handling at **61%**, leaving room for efficiency boost
✔ Young adults & older patients form the highest demand clusters
✔ Gender distribution fairly balanced
✔ GP & Orthopedics key referral pipelines
✔ Satisfaction score (5.18/10) lower than expected for ER standards

---

## 📈 Recommendations for Hospital Management

✔ Optimize triage workflow to cut wait times
✔ Staffing adjustments during peak months or hours
✔ Improve communication with patients during delays
✔ Coordinate with GP & ortho departments for better referral throughput
✔ Roll out satisfaction feedback loops for continuous improvement
✔ Use demographic insights to plan preventive health campaigns
✔ Apply predictive analytics for ER load forecasting
